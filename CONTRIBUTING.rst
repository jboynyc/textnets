and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

Write Documentation

Textnets could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official Textnets docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/jboynyc/textnets/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
  are welcome :)

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up **textnets** for local development.

1. Fork the ``textnets`` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/textnets.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtual environment. This is how you set up
   your fork for local development::

    $ cd textnets/
    $ poetry install
    $ poetry install -E doc

   If you use `nix <https://nixos.org/nix>`__, you can also invoke
   ``nix-shell`` in the repository to quickly create a development environment
   with the included ``shell.nix`` file.

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, format and lint your changes and run the
   unit tests::

    $ make lint
    $ make test

6. Commit your changes::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."

7. Push you changes and submit a pull request through GitHub::

    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Alternately, if you'd rather avoid using GitHub, email a patch to the
   maintainer. See https://git-send-email.io/ for instructions.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include unit tests if introducing new functionality.
2. Use docstrings, type annotations, and keep the documentation updated. Add
   illustrative code examples to the tutorial or advanced topics guide, as
   appropriate.
3. The pull request should work for all supported Python versions and
   platforms. Currently, these are CPython 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 on Mac,
   Windows and Linux, as well as PyPy 3.9 (Linux only). Check
   https://github.com/jboynyc/textnets/actions/workflows/ci.yml to make sure
   that the tests pass.

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run::

$ poetry version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git commit -a -m "Bump to version $(poetry version -s)"
$ git tag -a v$(poetry version -s)
$ make push

Tagged releases are immediately published to PyPI. `nixpkgs` may lag behind
after a new release but is generally kept in sync.
